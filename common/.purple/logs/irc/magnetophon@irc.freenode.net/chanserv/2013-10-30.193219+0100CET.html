Crossover users please go to #crossover, Cedega users please go to #cedega. If you are going to ask a question, rather than asking to ask the question or asking if someone is around: just ask it; if someone is around and they know the answer, they will answer it. If you ask to ask, chances are no one will respond.<br/>
