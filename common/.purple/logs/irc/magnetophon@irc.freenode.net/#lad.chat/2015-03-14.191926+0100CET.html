<font color="#062585"><font size="2">(07:19:50 PM)</font> <b>***caoliver</b></font> has wacky idea.  Has anyone though of using a 3d controller such as a spaceball for instrument control?<br/>
<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(07:20:13 PM)</font> <b>HarryHaaren:</b></font> caoliver, yerp, LeapMotion was my target device<br/>
<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(07:20:39 PM)</font> <b>HarryHaaren:</b></font> there&apos;s a dude using a 3D space-navigator mouse to move around a super-collider / processing patch to generate visuals / audio<br/>
<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(07:21:06 PM)</font> <b>HarryHaaren:</b></font> lots of stuff, bit of googling and things will turn up. The interesting parts is how to &quot;musically&quot; map the inputs to the output parameters<br/>
<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(07:21:07 PM)</font> <b>HarryHaaren:</b></font> did you have any ideas there?<br/>
<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(07:21:39 PM)</font> <b>caoliver:</b></font> I&apos;ve not thought about them for a while as they were horribly expensive when I first learned about them, but there are a lot of surplus units out there, and it strikes me they be like mod wheel/sticks on steroids.<br/>
<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(07:22:30 PM)</font> <b>caoliver:</b></font> Nothing particular.  Just thinking of ways to get more expression into synth playing.<br/>
<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(07:22:32 PM)</font> <b>HarryHaaren:</b></font> they&apos;re about 70e now I think? Its not too bad - the nice thing about them being 3d tracking, and pretty low latency<br/>
<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(07:25:22 PM)</font> <b>caoliver:</b></font> I was just contemplating why most instruments allow so much more expressiveness, and I think it&apos;s that you can control a lot of dimensions of sound shaping at once.  On a synth, you might get two independent controls: velocity/aftertouch and whatever you can get to with your free hand.<br/>
<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(07:27:20 PM)</font> <b>caoliver:</b></font> A 6 dof controller would get you in touch with more parameters, though playing it skillfully would be just as hard as with a traditional instrument.<br/>
<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(07:27:48 PM)</font> <b>caoliver:</b></font> So that&apos;s where my silly brain is wandering at the moment.<br/>
