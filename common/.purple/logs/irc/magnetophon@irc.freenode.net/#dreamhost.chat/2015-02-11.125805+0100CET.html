<font color="#16569E"><font size="2">(12:59:20 PM)</font> <b>magnetophon:</b></font> I have a problem using mutt for my mail: the certificate owner does not match the hostname. So I press 'a' for 'accept always', and mutt tells me the cert is saved. The next time I open mutt, the same happens.  My certificates file has multiple copies of the cert. (one for each time I press 'a', I presume).  deleting the cert file doesn't help.<br/>
