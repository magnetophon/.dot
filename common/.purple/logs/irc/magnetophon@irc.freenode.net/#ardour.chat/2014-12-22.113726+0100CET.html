<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(12:20:26 PM)</font> <b>Twister_:</b></font> Hello! I apologize for my bad English, but I translate with google as my english is not good. I can not export my project in Ardour . My project is quite large. 1 hour 20 minutes music. This is a multi-track live recording of a band. For several weeks I have now everything works . In that time I have now and exported for testing individual areas . It worked without any problems. Now I &apos;m done with everything and would like to expor<br/>
<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(12:20:51 PM)</font> <b>Twister_:</b></font> Unfortunately Ardour does not begin with the Export. I can open the dialog , set everything . I can click on exports , but then nothing happens . The progress bar remains at the beginning , I can cancel only . I also tried to export certain areas , even that does not work anymore . I am surprised that it has already worked once , but now can not remember where I have not changed my configuration .<br/>
<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(12:21:12 PM)</font> <b>Twister_:</b></font> I hope someone can help me further . Thank You<br/>

<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(12:58:10 PM)</font> <b>rgareus:</b></font> Twister_: this is a known issue with old versions of jack2. (it was fixed nov&apos;13, but jack 1.9.10 was only released in August&apos;14).<br/>
<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(12:59:04 PM)</font> <b>rgareus:</b></font> Twister_: the problem is a &apos;race condition&apos;  (depending on which thread wins the CPU-race jack can hang when it enters freewheeling-export mode). Sometimes re-starting ardour+jack can make it work.<br/>
<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(12:59:50 PM)</font> <b>rgareus:</b></font> the chance that it locks up is higher the more CPU/DSP load there is. More plugins -&gt; higher chance it will fail.<br/>
<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(01:00:31 PM)</font> <b>rgareus:</b></font> Twister_: if you have the option to update jack2, that will fix the issue.  Alternatively you can also use jack1.<br/>
<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(01:07:24 PM)</font> <b>Twister_:</b></font> I see, Jack Version is an old version, June, 4, 2013, i will update Jack<br/>
<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(01:15:58 PM)</font> <b>Twister_:</b></font> I &apos;m too stupid to update Jack. Do I need to uninstall and then reinstall Jack only or is there a real update?<br/>
