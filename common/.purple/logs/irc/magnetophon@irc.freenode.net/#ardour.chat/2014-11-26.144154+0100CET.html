<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(02:45:12 PM)</font> <b>Joeboy:</b></font> Ok, I have an update. It seems it is to do with having two midi tracks with the same data in them. If I disable the other track, the problem goes away. But just muting the other track doesn&apos;t help.<br/>
<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(02:45:42 PM)</font> <b>Joeboy:</b></font> Also contrary to what I said before, it&apos;s nothing to do with routing the midi to an external app. The same thing now happens with my lv2 track.<br/>
