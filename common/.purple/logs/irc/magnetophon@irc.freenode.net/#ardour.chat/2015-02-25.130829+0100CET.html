<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(01:12:00 PM)</font> <b>EamonnTobin:</b></font> Hi. I&apos;m trying tu use the ZITA AT-1 plugin on a voice recording but it ask for a midi input. Does anyone know how it works?<br/>
<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(01:26:17 PM)</font> <b>SzArAk:</b></font> EamonnTobin: I think you should use it on a Audio+Midi track, as that plugin takes midi notes as input information on how sound should be transposed.<br/>
<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(01:29:11 PM)</font> <b>SzArAk:</b></font> EamonnTobin: I&apos;ve just set up simple session to test it. It worked when I made an audio+midi track, recorded midi in it, and then supplied it with audio data (basically took output from different audio track and redirected it to that audio+midi track that has AT1)<br/>
