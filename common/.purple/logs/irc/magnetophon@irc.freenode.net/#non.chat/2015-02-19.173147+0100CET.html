<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(05:39:22 PM)</font> <b>nico202:</b></font> It is a really really simple jack audio recorder. &quot;I used to always keep a minidisc recorder in my studio running in a mode where when you pressed record it wrote the last 10 seconds of audio to the disk and then caught up to realtime and kept recording. The recorder died and haven&apos;t been able to replace it, so this is a simple jack app to do the same job. It has the advantage that it never clips and can be wired to any part<br/>
