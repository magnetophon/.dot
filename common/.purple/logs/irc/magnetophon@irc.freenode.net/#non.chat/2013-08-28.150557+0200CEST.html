<font size="2">(03:06:15 PM)</font><b> magnetophon left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 246 seconds).</b><br/>
<font color="#16569E"><font size="2">(03:54:15 PM)</font> <b>magnetophon1:</b></font> male: ok, I'm trying out the spatializer atm. Some thoughts:<br/>
<font color="#16569E"><font size="2">(03:55:42 PM)</font> <b>magnetophon1:</b></font> wow! lot's of doppler shift! that was probably a side effect of changing the predelay, right? at least not consciously coded in there. or?<br/>
<font color="#16569E"><font size="2">(03:57:21 PM)</font> <b>magnetophon1:</b></font> I expected some reverb. should i put apropriate IR's and a .conf file somewhere first?<br/>
<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(03:57:41 PM)</font> <b>fundamental:</b></font> magnetophon1: default input/output is a compile time option, try configuring it with ccmake. There should be a ~/.zynaddsubfxXML.cfg unless the source has been mucked around with<br/>
<font color="#16569E"><font size="2">(03:58:41 PM)</font> <b>magnetophon1:</b></font> fundamental: I wasn't able to compile due to some dependancy problems, so i took a premade .deb from the web somewhere.<br/>
<font color="#16569E"><font size="2">(03:59:26 PM)</font> <b>magnetophon1:</b></font> fundamental: wouldn't it make sense to make that part of the saved data, ie per session. or at least in a dotfile?<br/>
<font color="#16569E"><font size="2">(04:00:56 PM)</font> <b>magnetophon1:</b></font> male: back on the spatializer: I'm noticing loss of highs. are you doing hrtf's? are you simulating hf loss due to air absorption?<br/>
<font color="#16569E"><font size="2">(04:02:28 PM)</font> <b>magnetophon1:</b></font> the center of the gui is not the center of the stereo image. why is that? <br/>
<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(04:04:46 PM)</font> <b>fundamental:</b></font> magnetophon1: well, the only weird required dependency present in zyn is mxml, which most distros seem to have an good enough version, so I&apos;m not sure why you have compiling issues. I&apos;ve thought about adding the IO information somewhere, but a compile time flag with command line arguments seems good enough at the moment.<br/>
<font color="#16569E"><font size="2">(04:05:50 PM)</font> <b>magnetophon1:</b></font> fundamental: I'll try and compile again, and will let you know.<br/>
<font color="#16569E"><font size="2">(04:07:01 PM)</font> <b>magnetophon1:</b></font> fundamental: why do you say &quot;good enough&quot;? surely most people don't compile their own software, but everybody wants controll over their default io???<br/>
<font color="#16569E"><font size="2">(04:08:52 PM)</font> <b>magnetophon1:</b></font> fundamental: &quot;apt-get build-dep zynaddsubfx&quot; seems to go OK. I thought that was where the problem was... On to the next step...<br/>
<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(04:09:32 PM)</font> <b>fundamental:</b></font> magnetophon1: let&apos;s move this to #non or ##zynaddsubfx as it is not related to non/nsm at all<br/>
<font color="#16569E"><font size="2">(04:10:06 PM)</font> <b>magnetophon1:</b></font> fundamental: OK<br/>
