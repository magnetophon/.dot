Small nitpicks: the right hand guitar is a bit unsteady when it first starts playing the melody (right after it plays the chord), the cowbell is nice and understated, but I would like to hear if a hair more sounds better, the fadeout in the end feels unnatural (did you make it shorter?)<br/>

Also it asks wich UI i want each startup. So I checked for an old dotfile, from the previous version I had installed. I don't see one at all. Any pointers?<br/>
