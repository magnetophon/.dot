<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(04:01:17 PM)</font> <b>balleyne:</b></font> Does anyone have any recommendations for brands/models of MIDI controllers that work well with free software?<br/>
<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(04:01:37 PM)</font> <b>balleyne:</b></font> I read that MIDI devices all work well in GNU/Linux, but I&apos;m renting an Akai MPK-Mini 2 which does work well, except apparently requires some proprietary program to be run in Wine to fully access the device config? Seems pretty annoying...<br/>
<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(04:05:36 PM)</font> <b>edogawa:</b></font> balleyne: to put it short, if the device is class-compliant it just works in linux<br/>
<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(04:06:38 PM)</font> <b>edogawa:</b></font> balleyne: if an additional driver is needed in windows or macosx, it likely won&apos;t just work, instead either needs some firmware uploaded or some special driver written for it<br/>
<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(04:08:06 PM)</font> <b>edogawa:</b></font> some devices have extended features/modes that work only with the dedicated driver the company provides<br/>
<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(04:08:47 PM)</font> <b>edogawa:</b></font> then if you&apos;re lucky the company is helpful and supplies programming specs, or someone reverse-engineered it,<br/>
<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(04:09:12 PM)</font> <b>edogawa:</b></font> etc. etc.<br/>
<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(04:09:24 PM)</font> <b>balleyne:</b></font> edogawa, right, thanks. yeah, it&apos;s some of those extended features I&apos;m wondering about... like, the Akai seems to work just fine, but the Preset Editor application they offer to reconfigure it is a proprietary Windows program =\<br/>
<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(04:10:02 PM)</font> <b>balleyne:</b></font> I haven&apos;t been able to find a good list of free software friendly MIDI controllers either. There are some good lists of audio interfaces that work well, but the only MIDI guidance I&apos;ve found is around class-compliance...<br/>
