<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(11:50:40 AM)</font> <b>l33o:</b></font> hey hey<br/>
<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(11:52:56 AM)</font> <b>l33o:</b></font> saying thank you for nothing would be unfriendly so i say it in a more constructive way: please dont help me ever - even when i am asking for help, please dont help me or answer my questions - i could rescue data yesterday and it was great experience<br/>
<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(11:55:02 AM)</font> <b>l33o:</b></font> the fun part was my friend who could believe what he saw: another stupid user raising the shoulders and saying dont know while smiling and rescuing the dfata 5 minutes later though proofing that being a linux user isnt rocket science and that the advantages can be valued much much higher then the disadvantages of linux<br/>
<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(11:56:34 AM)</font> <b>l33o:</b></font> no sleep, no need to smoke weed, no restm no peace only work and things to do - every keystroke is very exhausting right now....<br/>
<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(11:57:12 AM)</font> <b>l33o:</b></font> testdisk is good ....tesdisk is goood.....test disk is good....repeating content is bad...repeating contebt is baaaad<br/>
<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(11:59:21 AM)</font> <b>l33o:</b></font> couldnt repair the mbr though, super block, mbr, gpt, who gives a poo....doesnt interrestm allways grab what you need<br/>
<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(12:05:21 PM)</font> <b>l33o:</b></font> mmmm, maybe i should start data recue biz<br/>
<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(12:26:59 PM)</font> <b>l33o:</b></font> hehehehe, i am not interrested in data recue - no need to talk about that hehehehe.....but one promise i can make to you: when the day is there, your interrest i mdata rescue will raise spontaneously<br/>
<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(12:29:19 PM)</font> <b>l33o:</b></font> and it seems that a trojan root  kit destroyed the mbr or superblock.....and, that wouldnt interrest any one, too, it seems that the trojan virus was able to write a script to automount the destroyed usb hard disk - and though it isnt therem the grub boot loader isnt booting into debian anymore, only into windows hehehehe....<br/>
<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(12:30:24 PM)</font> <b>l33o:</b></font> the attackers trying to attack linux - no news for some , for those who dont care, well...its no interresting news too<br/>
<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(12:31:22 PM)</font> <b>l33o:</b></font> but this is new to me, the virus could edited the start up script some how and automount the infected disk<br/>
<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(12:32:54 PM)</font> <b>l33o:</b></font> though i am not schooled for that, and i dont have any time and my friend hasnt time toom i declare the problem solved<br/>
