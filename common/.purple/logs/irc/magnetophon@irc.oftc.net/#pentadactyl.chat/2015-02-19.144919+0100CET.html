<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(03:25:48 PM)</font> <b>opa:</b></font> Does anyone know anything about the devs at this point?<br/>
<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(03:31:23 PM)</font> <b>shanks85:</b></font> Well, they updated the code one month ago. Their accounts are still logged in to IRC. I have no clue what their position regarding distributing Pentadactyl as an XPI is though.<br/>
<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(03:36:04 PM)</font> <b>njsg:</b></font> although John-Galt has been idle for 20 days, do we have other active developers here?<br/>
<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(03:36:13 PM)</font> <b>opa:</b></font> Or their position regarding development in general. Seems to me they abandoned the project without clearly stating that they did.<br/>
<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(03:36:54 PM)</font> <b>njsg:</b></font> or perhaps there has been no intention to abandon, just lack of time<br/>
<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(03:39:28 PM)</font> <b>opa:</b></font> I didn&apos;t mean to imply malicious intent. It would just be nice to have a clear statement on the project&apos;s future.<br/>
<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(03:47:35 PM)</font> <b>shanks85:</b></font> thesnowdog1 was on a couple days ago, but I guess not since then. I have seen John-Galt active on IRC and mailing lists related to work, but obviously I don&apos;t want to bug him there.<br/>
<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(03:50:02 PM)</font> <b>shanks85:</b></font> A statement would be nice. I assume the devs still use Pentadactyl. It seems like recent updates to the code have mainly been small compatibility updates. Several users have offered to help with distributing the XPI.<br/>
<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(03:50:04 PM)</font> <b>shanks85:</b></font> If the devs just want to maintain the code and leave the distribution to others that can likely be arranged, but it would be nice hear from them before going to the trouble of setting something up.<br/>
