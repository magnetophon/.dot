<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(03:58:19 PM)</font> <b>patgsio:</b></font> I have a probl√®m with internet connexion; the computer is running Debian version 7.7. It usually was ok with internet connection, but since some days it fails. When I tryied to do /etc/init.d/networking restart I got OK, but now i dont get anything. The internet connexion fail all times . i launched a liveCD to test if it was a problem something like devices, wires,... But there&apos;s no problem with all that. I think to re install debi<br/>
