<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(06:47:43 PM)</font> <b>dpkg:</b></font> Read chapter 4 (&quot;Upgrades from Debian 6.0&quot;) of the &lt;release notes&gt;.  In /etc/apt/sources.list, change &quot;squeeze&quot; to &quot;wheezy&quot; (noting that &lt;wheezy-backports&gt; have changed on the mirrors).  apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get upgrade &amp;&amp; apt-get dist-upgrade.  See also &lt;squeeze-&gt;wheezy failures&gt;.<br/>
<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(06:48:14 PM)</font> <b>dpkg:</b></font> If you have to ask how to do this, then you evidently don&apos;t know enough about Debian to cope with the problems that you _will_ experience; perhaps you should learn first and break second.   You should upgrade to testing first in any case.  Instead of running sid, ask me about &lt;testing&gt; &lt;backport&gt; &lt;debian-backports&gt;.<br/>
