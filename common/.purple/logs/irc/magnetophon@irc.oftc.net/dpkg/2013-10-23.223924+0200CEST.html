<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(10:39:24 PM)</font> <b>dpkg:</b></font> babilen wants you to know: When a TCP connection (e.g. telnet somehost 80) gives the error &quot;connection refused&quot;, it means that either the service in question is not running on the specified IP address at all (e.g. apache has died), or that a firewall has rejected your SYN packet and sent back a rejection packet to you.  It&apos;s a VERY CLEAR, EXPLICIT error message and ALWAYS means one of those two things.<br/>
