# CACHE DIRECTORY. Directory where blocklists will be downloaded and stored.
# They will only be updated if the server has a newer version.
cachedir="/var/cache/hostsblock" # DEFAULT

# WORK DIRECTORY. Temporary directory where interim files will be unzipped and
# processed. This directory will be deleted after hostsblock completes itself.
tmpdir="/tmp" # DEFAULT

# FINAL HOSTSFILE. The final hosts file that combines together all downloaded
# blocklists. If not using a dns caching daemon like dnsmasq, this should be
# /etc/hosts. Include hosts file entries which you want to maintain in the
# "hostshead" entry, such as your loopback device (e.g. 127.0.0.1 localhosts)
# hostsfile="/var/lib/hostsblock/hosts.block" # For use with a dnscacher, e.g dnsmasq
# hostsfile="/etc/hosts" # DEFAULT. If not using a dns caching daemon
hostsfile="/home/bart/nixosConfig/hosts" # DEFAULT. If not using a dns caching daemon

# REDIRECT URL. Url to which blocked hosts will be redirect, either 0.0.0.0 or
# 127.0.0.1. This replaces any entries to 0.0.0.0 and 127.0.0.1. If you run a
# pixelserver such as pixelserv or kwakd, it is advisable to use 127.0.0.1.
redirecturl="0.0.0.0" # DEFAULT

# ALLOW REDIRECTS. Give "1" here to allow entries from blocklists that redirect
# rather than just block. Redirects present a certain security hazard, so make
# sure that you trust your blocklist providers if you give "1" here. Redirects
# allow those who have corrupted DNS servers to access sites not available
# otherwise.
redirects="0" # DEFAULT

# POSTPROCESSING SUBROUTINE. Commands to run after the new hostsfile has been
# created. You may configure your dnscacher here (see example), or use the new
# automatic detection routine.
# postprocess(){                        #
   # systemctl restart dnsmasq.service # For dnsmasq under systemd
# }                                     #

postprocess(){                        #
   # /bin/true                         # DEFAULT. If not using a dns caching daemon
   /run/current-system/sw/bin/true    # DEFAULT. If not using a dns caching daemon
}                                     #

# HEAD FILE. File containing hosts file entries which you want at the beginning
# of the resultant hosts file, e.g. for loopback devices and IPV6 entries. Use
# your original /etc/hosts file here if you are writing your final blocklist to
# /etc/hosts so as to preserve your loopback devices. Give hostshead="0" to
# disable this feature. For those targeting /etc/hosts, it is advisable to copy
# their old /etc/hosts file to this file so as to preserve existing entries.
#hostshead="0"
hostshead="/nix/store/yskaxvzw2y83518lsmbyi3x19skclyyd-hostsblock-20161213/etc/hosts.head" # DEFAULT

# BLACKLISTED SUBDOMAINS. File containing specific subdomains to blacklist which
# may not be in the downloaded blacklists. Be sure to provide not just the
# domain, e.g. "google.com", but also the specific subdomain a la
# "adwords.google.com" without quotations.
# blacklist="/nix/store/yskaxvzw2y83518lsmbyi3x19skclyyd-hostsblock-20161213/etc/black.list"

# WHITELIST. File containing the specific subdomains to allow through that may
# be blocked by the downloaded blocklists. In this file, put a space in front of
# a string in order to let through that specific site (without quotations), e.g.
# " www.example.com" will unblock "http://www.example.com" but not
# "http://subdomain.example.com". Leave no space in front of the entry to
# unblock all subdomains that contain that string, e.g. ".dropbox.com" will let
# through "www.dropbox.com", "dl.www.dropbox.com", "foo.dropbox.com",
# "bar.dropbox.com", etc.
# whitelist="/nix/store/yskaxvzw2y83518lsmbyi3x19skclyyd-hostsblock-20161213/etc/white.list"
whitelist="/home/bart/.config/hostsblock/white.list"

#### NEW PARAMETERS ####

# CONNECT_TIMEOUT. Parameter passed to curl. Determines how long to try to
# connect to each blocklist url before giving up.
connect_timeout=60 # DEFAULT

# RETRY. Parameter passed to curl. Number of times to retry connecting to
# each blocklist url before giving up.
retry=0 # DEFAULT

# BACKUP_OLD. Save old hosts.block file. Passing "0" or "no" here has hostsblock
# NOT backup the old hosts.block file. Passing "1" or "yes" here has hostsblock
# save an uncompressed copy of hosts.block. Passing a compression command with
# gzip-compatible syntax has hostsblock save a compressed copy of hosts.block.
# By default, hostsblock attempts to save a gzip-compressed copy. If it can't
# find gzip, it makes no backup.
# backup_old="gzip" # DEFAULT

# RECYCLE_OLD. If, for some reason, new downloaded blocklists contain fewer
# entries than previous versions, this option allows hostsblock to recycle the
# old main blocklist (e.g. hosts.block) so that old entries are preserved. In
# effect, the old hosts.block file becomes another downloaded blocklist.
# 1 = hostsblock WILL recycle old hosts.block, 0 = hostsblock will NOT.
recycle_old=0 # DEFAULT
# recycle_old=1 # DEFAULT

# VERBOSITY. How much info hostsblock should provide while running. Follows
# the following scheme:
### Level 0: Only fatal errors
### Level 1: Level 0 + non-fatal errors
### Level 2: Level 1 + updates to cache files
### Level 3: Level 2 + narration of each major phase
### Level 4: Level 3 + step-by-step details of all processes
### Level 5: Level 4 + stdout/stderr from sub-processes like curl, zip, 7za, etc.
verbosity=3 # DEFAULT

# ANNOTATE. File where hostsblock will save information on which blocklist files
# affect which urls. Needed for hostsblock-urlcheck.
annotate=/var/lib/hostsblock.db.gz

# BLOCKLISTS. List all blocklists to be downloaded as an array.Files may be
# either plaintext, zip, or 7z files. Hostsfiles will identify zip and 7z files
# by their file extension.
